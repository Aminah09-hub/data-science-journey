# 🧠 Data Science Journey

Welcome to my personal data science journey!  
I’m a beginner learning core skills step by step — from Python fundamentals to machine learning — and uploading my Jupyter notebooks daily as I grow. This repo is my public portfolio to document progress, share code, and stay accountable.

## 📝 Notes
- [ch for ch in ... if ...] This is called a list comprehension. It builds a new list containing only the characters that passed the filter.
- Day 14 Reflection: Explored Pandas for real data manipulation using the Titanic dataset—key takeaway: .loc vs .iloc for efficient indexing!
